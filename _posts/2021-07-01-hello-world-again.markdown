A fresh start on an empty slate? Or just another experiment on different tech?

Who knows. Anyway, I'm finding static websites and Jekyll quite exciting right now, and wanted to give it a try.

My old writing can currently be found at [Medium](https://blog.jarkkolaine.com) -- I migth or might not import it back to this site from there. Time will tell.

So: hello, world. Once again!
